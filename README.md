# HostedNetworkControl
Acts like a GUI wrapper for the windows netsh.exe utility for hosted LANs.

Another project I found while browsing through my archives. Decided to upload it here because why not.

This project features:
* A live Network Client list
* Automatic MAC address resolver
* Host Name resolver
* Latency resolver
* Tools to change Hosted Network settings.
